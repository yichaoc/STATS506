# STATS506

This project explores the relationship between dietary behaviors and alcohol consumption. 

We used data from the 2005-2006 NHANES data from the CDC. 

Given that our outcome was the number of alcoholic drinks consumed, we used a negative binomial model. Furthermore, we also present a version of a model accounting for zero-inflation. 

Analysis was completed using R (Yichao), SAS(Xinrui), and Stata (Amanda).

We discussed about the topic and decided what data and method to use via e-mail. We made improvements on our core analysis together and collaborated to finish the group8.html. During the project, we checked each other's work to see whether we have got the same results. 

The final files are found in the main folder (group8.html, group8.Rmd). The data folder contains our data files, and there is a folder for each type of software used that contains the relevant scripts.
