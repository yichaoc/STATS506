# STATS506

This project explores the relationship between dietary behaviors and alcohol consumption. 

We used data from the 2005-2006 NHANES data from the CDC. 

Given that our outcome was the number of alcoholic drinks consumed, we used a negative binomial model. Furthermore, we also present a version of a model accounting for zero-inflation. 

Analysis was completed using R (Yichao), SAS(Xinrui), and Stata (Amanda).

We discussed about the topic and decided what data and method to use via e-mail.

The final files are found in the main folder (group8.html, group8.Rmd). The data folder contains our data files, and there is a folder for each type of software used that contains the relevant scripts.
