# STATS506

This project explores the relationship between dietary behaviors and alcohol consumption. We used data from the 2005-2006 NHANES data from the CDC. Given that our outcome was the number of alcoholic drinks consumed, we used a negative binomial model. Furthermore, we also present a version of a model accounting for zero-inflation. Analysis was completed using R (Yichao and Xinrui) and Stata (Amanda).

Currently, we have completed the analysis in both programs and still need to combine everything into one final document.
